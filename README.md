This is a random password generator that is completely unsecure. It asks you what sort of characters you would like initially, and based on your choices it creates an array of possible characters to pick from as it generates a password to your chosen length. i do this by making seperate arrays for the seperate choices (ex: if they want spec chars, there is a specfic array prefilled withs all possible special characters that will be called on) and as the code reads, it splices on your different choices on too a whole seperate array to randomly selected characters from.

If user selects yes to an option then they would want atleast of that choice in the generated password, so at each step of choices, it adds one of the characters randomly chosen from the corresponding array, and then passes the variable of the generatedpassword on to the next step, where lastly the function fills in the remaining diffenrence between what the passwords length is and what the user wants with randomly chosen characters.
